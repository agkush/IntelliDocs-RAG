**IntelliDocs-RAG** is a smart, offline chatbot that allows you to interact with your personal PDF documents securely ‚Äî **without needing an internet connection**. Powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow and a locally hosted LLM (via Ollama), the system delivers fast, context-aware responses by understanding and referencing multiple uploaded PDFs.

This tool was created as a **Final Year B.Tech Project** at the **National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra (NIT Kurukshetra)**.

>
> *"Summarize the findings in paper 2."*  
> *"Which papers involve time-series analysis with neural networks?"*  
>
> The system analyzes the content and returns precise answers using a local LLM ‚Äî ensuring speed, privacy, and ease of use.
